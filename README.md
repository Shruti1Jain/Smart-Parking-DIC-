# Smart-Parking-DIC-

This project proposes a method for the automation of a parking system.
The vehicles gets registered while entering the building or the organization by
the use of a camera thatâ€™s installed at the entrance.A machine learning model is
used that detects the number plate and what type of vehicle it is. The number
plate and other details of the vehicle are stored in a database. These details can
be checked on the dashboard made for the same purpose. The database can also
be managed using the dashboard. Manual entries can also be done if due to
some problems the camera is unable to detect the number plate. The dashboard
can be used to search a vehicle's history and all the vehicles that have entered
the organization in the past. This is done in real time.
